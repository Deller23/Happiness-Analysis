# 🌍 World Happiness Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the factors influencing world happiness by analyzing the **World Happiness Dataset**. Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, we investigate how economic, social, and regional factors correlate with happiness levels.

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Dataset Used**: World Happiness Report dataset
- **Key Features**:
  - `Overall Rank`: Rank based on happiness score
  - `Country or Region`: Name of the country or region
  - `Score`: Overall happiness score
  - `GDP per Capita`: Economic factor affecting happiness
  - `Social Support`: Support systems in place
  - `Healthy Life Expectancy`: Impact of health on happiness
  - `Freedom to Make Life Choices`: Influence of personal freedom
  - `Generosity`: Willingness to donate and help others
  - `Perceptions of Corruption`: Perceived corruption levels

## 🔍 Analysis & Insights

1. **Happiness Score vs. Overall Rank** – Higher-ranked countries tend to have significantly higher happiness scores.
2. **Top 10 & Bottom 10 Happiest Countries** – Europe dominates the happiest rankings, while political instability correlates with lower scores.
3. **Economic Impact on Happiness** – A strong correlation between GDP per capita and happiness score.
4. **Social Support Matters** – Higher social support correlates with greater happiness.
5. **Health and Happiness** – Countries with higher healthy life expectancy tend to report higher happiness scores.
6. **Generosity & Corruption Perception** – Mixed impact on happiness, but notable trends in different regions.
7. **Geographical Trends** – European countries have higher median happiness scores compared to other continents.
